<- assignment operator, assigns a the value on the right of the operator to the symbol or variable on the left

# comment symbol - all text after the hash symbol is ignored in R execution

Typing an objects name plus enter auto-prints the objects value

R labels the first element of each line in square brackets at the beginning of the line with the count [1]
==================================================

Objects - all the things that can be manipulated in R

Vector - basic type, must be of the same class

List - exception, a vector object that can have more than 1 class

vector function  - vector() - takes 2 arguments - class, and length - to create an empty vector

Numbers - R thanks of all numbers as numeric objects (double precision real numbers) - if you want an integer you need to specifiy with a capital L

Inf - Infinity, special value that can be used in calculations - 1/0 = Inf

NaN - not defined number (Not a number) - can be through of as a missing value

Attributes - R values you can have attributes, class, name, length, user defined attributes or meta data

attributes() - function to set the attributes
====================================================

c() - basically the concatenate function to create vecots of objects

TRUE, FALSE or T,F 

mixing obect types will result in R using coercion to convert into the least common denominator class - Y <- c("a", TRUE) becomes a character vector not a logical

Coercion can be forced using the as operator which will force the vector into the specified class " t<-"12" as.numeric(t)"

Explicit conversion does not always work, if the coercion is non-sensical, then the NAS value will result

Lists - like a vector, but every element can be a different class

list() - list function to create a list - prints out differently
=============================================================

Marices are special vectors in R, has a dimension attribute which is itself an integer vector of lenght 2 (number of rows and number of columns)

matrix(nrow=_, ncol=_) - matrix function specifying the number of rows and number of columns

matrices are constructed column wise, you start filling column 1 up to max number of rows then col 2 is built, etc...

dim() - used to assign the dimension attribute like the dimension for a matrix

binding columns and rows 
cbind - columns
rbind - rows
================================================================

Factor - vector to represent categorical data, can be ordered (ranked) or not ordered - integer value where each integer has a label - treated specially by modeling packages, factors are self-describing (coding are built in)

factor() - factor funtion to created factor function

Levels argument sets the order

baseline level - first level in the factor, created using alphabetical order by default, other methods must be explicitly defined using the levels argument
